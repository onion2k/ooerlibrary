Cubes in a twisted spiral to make a lovely Christmas tree, with baubles and lights.

The cubes are merged in to a single mesh to speed things along a little, and lit by an ambient light source. If lights are selected then they're added as basic spheres with red or green point lights in the same positions. Baubles are just shiny red spheres.

This demo also includes dat.gui to control a few things.
